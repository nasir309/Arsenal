    <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2> <br>
     <br>
    <P> Salaz bbq has a rich history in Kenya's hospitality industry. The group was founded in 1972 with a vision of blending nature, community, and exceptional service. Over the decades, Salaz has grown into one of Kenya’s leading bbq chains, offering diverse experiences across eight unique properties.

        One of its most iconic bbq, Salaz Stanley, dates back to 1902 when Mayence Bent opened the first guest house in Nairobi. The hotel quickly expanded, but in 1904, a fire destroyed the original building. Bent rebuilt it, and over time, Salaz Stanley became a landmark, hosting famous guests like Princess Elizabeth and Ernest Hemingway. The hotel also played a role in Kenya’s history, housing the country’s first Stock Exchange and introducing the renowned Tusker beer in 1922.
        
        Salaz Hotels now operates a variety of properties, including Salaz Panafric, Salaz Whitesands Beach Resort & Spa, and several safari lodges. Each location offers unique experiences, from city luxury to wildlife adventures.

    </P>
